# Turtle movements

The turtle’s motion is recorded while noise is introduced at varying levels. Noise is generated by random.gauss(0,x)

## No Noise

File no_noise.mp4 records the movement when there is no noise. 

## Noise Range 0-0.05

File noise_0_05.mp4 records the movement when the noise is generated between 0 and 0.05

## Noise Range 0-velocity/10

File noise_vel_10.mp4 records the movement when the noise is generated between 0 and velocity/10

## Noise Range 0-velocity/100

File noise_vel_100.mp4 records the movement when the noise is generated between 0 and velocity/100

## Specification of velocity

The velocity keeps on changing, It is bigger when the turtle is far from the angle, and smaller when it is near the angle.
